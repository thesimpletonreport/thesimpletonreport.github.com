title: Introducing The Simpleton Report, Online
---

Hey, it's Anon Pseudo. About a year ago I decided to self publish a small one sheet recap of weekly current events. Turns out, putting those up around a middle school gets you into trouble. Welcome to the safe haven for The Simpleton Report, unfiltered, and uncensored.

This website is absolutely free to use and to comment on, every article I write is under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal license](https://github.com/thesimpletonreport/thesimpletonreport.github.com/blob/master/LICENSE.md), as well as the code that I hand wrote to make this site. If you click on this article to read the entire thing, you may notice a comments box down below. You don't have to sign up for anything, and it's entirely free. There are a few "don't be a dick" guidelines, that I copy pasted from the [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). These aren't neccessarily rules, but they might be good to go by to keep this site a safe place for discussion.

> ### Please  do
> 
> *   **Remember the human.** When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask
> yourself "Would I say it to the person's face?" or "Would I get jumped
> if I said this to a buddy?"
> 
> *   **Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.**
> 
> *   **Read the rules of a community before making a submission.** These are usually found in the sidebar.
> 
> *   **Read the reddiquette.** Read it again every once in a while. Reddiquette is a living, breathing, working document which may change
> over time as the community faces new problems in its growth.
> 
> *   **Moderate based on quality, not opinion.** Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.
> 
> *   **Use proper grammar and spelling.**[ Intelligent discourse requires a standard system of
> communication.](http://reddit.com/info/1mbhv/comments) Be open for
> gentle corrections.
> 
> *   **Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free.** If it is an outrageous topic, share your crazy outrage in the comment section.
> 
> *   **Look for the original source of content**, and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another,
> and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through
> those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually
> deserves the traffic.
> 
> *   **Post to the most appropriate community possible.** Also, consider cross posting if the contents fits more communities.
> 
> *   **Vote.** If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is
> posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.
> 
> *   **Search for duplicates before posting.** Redundancy posts add nothing new to previous conversations. That said, sometimes bad
> timing, a bad title, or just plain bad luck can cause an interesting
> story to fail to get noticed. Feel free to post something again if you
> feel that the earlier posting didn't get the attention it deserved and
> you think you can do better.
> 
> *   **Link to the direct version of a media file** if the page it was found on isn't the creator's and doesn't add additional information or
> context.
> 
> *   **Link to canonical and [persistent URLs](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html) where possible,** not
> temporary pages that might disappear. In particular, use the
> "permalink" for blog entries, not the blog's index page.
> 
> *   **Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something,** and do so carefully and tactfully.
> 
> *   **[ Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/spam)** any spam you find.
> 
> *   **Browse the [ new submissions page](http://www.reddit.com/new/) and vote on it.** Regard it, perhaps, as a public service.
> 
> *   **Actually read an article before you vote on it** (as opposed to just basing your vote on the title).
> 
> *   **Feel free to post links to your own content** (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down,
> take a good hard look in the mirror &#8212; you just might be a
> spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out
> of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.
> 
> *   **Posts containing explicit material such as nudity, horrible injury etc,** add [NSFW](/wiki/help/faqs/nsfw) (Not Safe For Work) for
> nudity, and tag. However, if something IS safe for work, but has a
> risqu&#233; title, tag as SFW (Safe for Work). Additionally, use your
> best judgement when adding these tags, in order for everything to go
> swimmingly.
> 
> *   **State your reason for any editing of posts.** Edited submissions are marked by an asterisk (\*) at the end of the timestamp after three
> minutes. For example: a simple "Edit: spelling" will help explain.
> This avoids confusion when a post is edited after a conversation
> breaks off from it. If you have another thing to add to your original
> comment, say "Edit: And I also think..." or something along those
> lines.
> 
> *   **Use an "Innocent until proven guilty" mentality.** Unless there is obvious proof that a submission is fake, or is whoring karma,
> please don't say it is. It ruins the experience for not only you, but
> the millions of people that browse reddit every day.
> 
> *   **Read over your submission for mistakes before submitting**, especially the title of the submission. Comments and the content of
> self posts can be edited after being submitted, however, the title of
> a post can't be. Make sure the facts you provide are accurate to avoid
> any confusion down the line.
>

> 
> ### Please  don't
> 
> *   **Engage in illegal activity.**
> 
> *   **Post someone's personal information,** or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and
> screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get
> outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch
> hunts and vigilantism [ hurt innocent people too
> often](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d7m1c/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/),
> and such posts or comments will be removed. Users posting personal
> info are subject to an immediate account deletion. If you see a user
> posting personal info, [ please contact the
> admins.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23reddit.com&subject=posting%20of%20personal%20info)
> Additionally, on pages such as Facebook, where personal information is
> often displayed, please mask the personal information and personal
> photographs using a blur function, erase function, or simply block it
> out with color. When personal information is relevant to the post
> (i.e. comment wars) please use color blocking for the personal
> information to indicate whose comment is whose.
> 
> *  **Repost deleted/removed information.** Remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was
> a picture of gore? Resist the urge to repost it. It doesn't matter
> what the content was. If it was deleted/removed, it should stay
> deleted/removed.
> 
> *   **Be (intentionally) rude at all.** By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better
> for all of us.
> 
> *   **Follow those who are [ rabble rousing](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rabble) against another
> redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's
> being presented.** Those who are inciting this type of action often
> have malicious reasons behind their actions and are, more often than
> not, a troll. Remember, every time a redditor who's contributed large
> amounts of effort into assisting the growth of community as a whole is
> driven away, projects that would benefit the whole easily flounder.
> 
> *   **Ask people to [ Troll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) others on
> reddit,** in real life, or on other blogs/sites. We aren't your
> personal army.
> 
> *   **Conduct personal attacks on other commenters.** Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.
> 
> *   **Start a flame war.** Just report and "walk away". If you really feel you have to confront them, leave a polite message with a quote or
> link to the rules, and no more.
> 
> *   **Insult others.** Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and
> encouraged.
> 
> *   **Troll.**[ Trolling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29) does not
> contribute to the conversation.
> 
> *   **Take moderation positions in a community where your profession,** employment, or biases could pose a direct conflict of
> interest to the neutral and user driven nature of reddit.
> 
> ##### In regard to voting
> 
> *   **Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it.** Think before you downvote and take a moment to
> ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to
> the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to
> stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing
> so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes
> are given for good reasons.
> 
> *   **Mass downvote someone else's posts.** If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all
> means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way
> to seek out an enemy's posts.
> 
> *   **Moderate a story based on your opinion of its source.** Quality of content is more important than who created it.
> 
> *   **Upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.** Don't upvote or downvote comments and posts just because the poster's
> username is familiar to you. Make your vote based on the content.

Let's have a great year of free news for the internet, shall we?
